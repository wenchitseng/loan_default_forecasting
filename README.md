# Loan Default Forecasting
This report is our machine learning course project. We experimented with different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, and applied various preprocessing techniques to improve benchmarks. When users enter their information (age, income, employment status, loan intent, etc.) into the model, it outputs the likelihood of loan default.

## Overview
**Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nanditapore/credit-risk-analysis/data

**Problem**: The challenge of making informed decisions when extending credit.    

**Action**: Developing and improving benchmark models with cross-validation, SMOTE, and other preprocessing techniques.

**Result**: Selecting the best model (XGBoost) and using it as an interactive tool to evaluate the probability of loan default risk.
